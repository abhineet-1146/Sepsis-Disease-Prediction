Sepsis is a significant public health issue with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and medical costs. Sepsis outcomes are better with early detection and antibiotic treatment. The fundamental need for early detection and treatment still exists, despite the fact that professional critical care societies have proposed new clinical criteria to help identify sepsis. Researchers have developed algorithms for the early detection of sepsis in response, but it has been impossible to directly compare these approaches due to variations in patient cohorts, clinical variables, sepsis criteria, prediction tasks, evaluation metrics, and other factors.
The Knowledge Discovery in Databases process will be used to accomplish this. There are 4 steps in this process:

1. Picking out the multivariate time series data set from the database and extracting it.
2. Investigated the data, handled missing data, and cleaned up the time series to create a tidy dataset by handling noise and outliers.
3. Using a variety of machine learning algorithms, creating a predictive model that links a time series of biomedical measurements with a real-time severity indicator (probability of mortality).
4. Assessment and verification: The utilisation of two databases offers the chance to validate the various predictive models that will be created.
